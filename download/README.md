# Executables to download


## Debian package

Users of Debian, Ubuntu and other distributions that rely on Debian packages, the `endlines-1.9.1-amd64.deb` file is for you. You can install it with a GUI installer (like gdebi) or run `sudo dpkg --install endlines-1.9.1-amd64.deb` from the command line if that's all you have.


## Executable files for Linux and OSX

If you don't rely on Debian packages, the folder contains precompiled binaries for Linux/AMD64 and OSX. You can rename the one that fits you to `endlines` and move it to some place on the path, such as `/usr/local/bin`.
